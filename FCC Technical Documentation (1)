        Crochet is a wonderful hobby. You probably sit down to crochet whenever you have free time but have you ever thought about how crochet originated? 

If you’re interested in knowing more about the history of crochet, you’ve come to the right place.

What does crochet mean? Where did crochet come from? Who invented it? Who was the first to create a crochet hook? I answer all these questions and more in this article. I’ll delve deep into the rich history of crochet.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and I call it crochet, and so do the French, Belgians, Italians and Spanish-speaking people. The skill is known as haken in Holland, haekling in Denmark, hekling in Norway and virkning in Sweden.

Other forms of handwork - knitting, embroidery and weaving - can be dated far back in time, thanks to archeological finds, written sources and pictorial representations of various kinds. But no one is quite sure when and where crochet got its start. The word comes from croc, or croche, the Middle French word for hook, and the Old Norse word for hook is krokr.

      <p>Crochet was first called crochet in the mid-1800s. 

In the early 1700s, where tambouring reached Europe after spreading through India, Persia, North America, and Turkey, the method changed.

The background fabric used for tambouring was removed. The French named the new technique, “crochet in the air.”

In the early 1800s, shepherd’s knitting came about, along with the shepherd’s hook. It’s thicker than a modern crochet hook but still with a hooked end.

By the mid-1800s, it became known as crochet or slip stitch crochet. In the 60s, the granny square and crocheted homeware appeared and became more popular.

The earliest known published crochet pattern was in a Dutch magazine called Penélopé, in 1823. It listed instructions for five types of purses.

      <p>
        In early centuries, man - and it was the job of the men - created his handwork for practical purposes. Hunters and fishermen created knotted strands of woven fibers, cords or strips of cloth to trap animals and snare fish or birds. Other uses included knotted game bags, fishing nets and open- worked cooking utensils.
      </p>

      <p>
        Handwork was expanded to include personal decoration for special occasions such as religious rites, celebrations, marriages or funerals. One might see ceremonial costumes with crochet- like ornamentation and decorative trimmings for arms, ankles and wrists.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 16th century Europe, royalty and the wealthy lavished themselves in lace- trimmings, gowns, jackets, headpieces - and the poor folk could only dream of wearing such things. So, it is surmised, crochet was developed as the poor people's imitation of the rich man's lace.

      In a German publication dated 1847, it stated that one should always "keep the same tension, either crochet loosely or crochet tightly, otherwise an attractively even texture will not be achieved. Moreover, if not working in the round, you have to break off your yarn at the end of each row, since this gives a finer finish to the crocheted article." Today's patterns, thank goodness, usually instruct us to work both the right and wrong sides of the fabric we are creating. This change came about at the turn of the 20th century.

    <p>
      Before patterns were written down, one simply copied someone else's work. Samples were made and sewn onto pages and bound like scrapbooks, sewn onto large pieces of fabric or kept loose in a bag or box. In her travels, author Annie Potter found some of these scrapbooks -dating from the late 1800s- still in use by nuns in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way to collect stitch samples was to crochet different stitches together in long, narrow bands - some made by adults, some begun in school and added on to over the years. (Later on in Europe, from 1916 to about 1926, readers could buy small pattern samples along with their yarn.)

The earliest crochet patterns known to date were printed in 1824.
    </p>
    <p>
     The earliest patterns were for purses of gold and silver silk thread in colorwork crochet.

Crochet books were found in many countries, often translated from one language into another. The most notable expert on crochet was Mlle. Riego de la Branchardiere, who published more than a hundred books, many about crochet.

      Techniques for working with a needle -knitting, netting, weaving, twisting, braiding, knotting - have been called by many names throughout history. They include needle-coiling, knotless netting, cross-knit looping, looped needle-netting, vatsom, coptic knitting, naalebinding, Tunisian crochet, tambour, needle lace, lace making, tatting, macrame, sprang and shepherd's knitting.
      <p>
        Throughout the ages, a variety of materials have been used: hair, grasses, reeds, animal fur and sinew, hemp, flax, wool, gold and silver and copper strands, silk, white cotton thread, wool yarns (soft zephyr yam, lustre yarn, double cable yarn, carpet yarn), cotton yarn (anchor and estramadura), silk thread (cordonnet and floss), linen thread, hemp thread, mohair, chenille, novelty mixtures, metal thread and string.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we have at our disposal an enormously wide selection of cotton, wool, silk and synthetic yarns. We can also crochet with such unusual materials as copper wire, strips of plastic, sisal, jute, scraps of fabric, unspun wool and even dog hair.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how about the crochet tool? Today we walk into a yarn shop or Walmart and purchase aluminum, plastic or steel hooks available in more than 25 sizes. In earlier times, however, they used whatever they could get their hands on - fingers first, then hooks made of metal, wood, fishbone, animal bone, horn, old spoons, teeth from discarded combs, brass, mother-of-pearl, morse (walrus tusk), tortoiseshell, ivory, copper, steel, vulcanite, ebonite, silver and agate.

       1812 – A book is published called The Memoirs of a Highland Lady by Elizabeth Grant. In her writing, she talks about “shepherd’s knitting,” essentially known today as slip stitch crochet. Shepherds knitting was and still is a version of crochet.

1823 – The first crochet pattern is published in a Dutch magazine named Penélopé, with instructions for purses.

1835 – The first patterns for crocheted bags were published in Germany and The Netherlands in many magazines. By this time, patterns introduced two more stitches to create variance in the designs, single and double crochet.

1844 – The process of mercerization is invented. This is a process added to the manufacturing of cotton to make it stronger and more durable. This means it becomes a lot easier to crochet with and becomes a more popular fiber of choice. 

1846 – In the UK, magazines begin publishing patterns on how to make Spanish needle lace. The method of making crochet has changed too. Instead of only working through the back loop, and the yarn cut off at each row’s end. It shows working both, and the rows worked back and forth and then turned. The new method was similar to crochet today.

The Later 1840s – As discussed in this post, the method of Irish crochet lace is produced. It becomes a way for impoverished people to make money in The Great Irish Potato Famine.

The 1850s and 1860s – Due to the industrial revolution, things became mass-produced and cheaper to buy. This includes crochet hooks. It also causes many middle-class and upper-class women to have more free time. This means increasingly crochet is becoming popular as a hobby.

1867 – The very popular, and still running to this day, fashion magazine Harper’s Bazaar is founded.

1910–1920 – Due to the Edwardian period in the UK, fashion changes and becomes more detailed. Popular styles of crocheted clothes change to reflect this.

The World Wars – The governments encourage women to contribute to the war effort and crochet items for the troops and soldiers in need.

After The Wars – With restrictions on textiles lifted, crochet is rediscovered as a hobby. It becomes much more popular, as do other fiber arts.

The 1960s & 1970s – Possibly due to the hippie and other alternative subcultures, crochet items become very fashionable, particularly those made with granny squares.

1994 – Gwen Blakley Kinsler founded The Crochet Guild of America. She aimed to encourage people all over the USA to discover the enjoyable hobby of crocheting.

2007 – Ravelry, the knitting, crochet, and fiber arts forum, is created. Crochet and social media merge, becoming very popular and causing the creation of crochet blogs and communities.

    <header>The Development of Different Crochet Stitches</header>
    <article>
      <p>
        Here is a list of the most common crochet stitches, from the earliest development to the most recent.

The slip stitch, first originating from shepherd knitting, is used as both a crochet method and to join stitches together to create rings.
The chain stitch, developed shortly after the slip stitch, is the most basic one. It’s used to begin nearly every project.
The single crochet stitch is the easiest stitch to learn besides the two first mentioned. (It’s called the double crochet stitch in the UK.)
The double crochet stitch is a more complicated version of single crochet, and it’s very versatile. It can be used in many different situations and projects. (It’s called the treble stitch in the UK.)
The half-double crochet stitch was developed as a half stitch or an in-between stitch to single and double crochet. (It’s called the half treble stitch in the UK.)

        The modern crochet hook is closely related to a tambour needle and the shepherd’s hook. 
      Past crochet hooks have been made of many materials. Ivory, bone, porcupine quill, and other unique materials.

Modern crochet hooks are made from bamboo, aluminum, plastic, and glass. Also, artisan-made hooks made from materials like particular types of wood. 

Some also have grips to make it easier to crochet for longer, and overall for comfort.

      <p>Some crochet hooks have survived from as far back as the 19th century. In 1917 America, the Boye Needle Co. manufactured the first set of American crochet hooks. In 1923, the first aluminum hooks appeared.</p>

    <article>
     Knitting. Crochet was the last out of Nålebinding, knitting, and crochet. The technique called Nålebinding came long before knitting or crochet. The history of crochet is much shorter than the other two but just as fascinating.

Nålebinding is Danish, meaning ‘binding with a needle’ or ‘needle binding.’ The women of the Nanti Tribe (an indigenous people of the Camisea region of Peru) still practice it.

The technique also remains popular in Scandinavia and the Balkans.

Nålebinding can be mistaken for knitting, but modern knitting, started in the early 11th century CE, with ancient Egyptian socks.

Following knitting, the word crochet for the first time appeared in 1823 in the Dutch magazine Penélopé.
